# Ciaran's Game Statistics Visualiser

## Description:
	The concept behind this came from games and most software today lack the ability to give nice statistics in real time about input.
	
	The reason why I did this project was to achieve 3 things:
	-> Dive in deep in with an actual Javascript project and push my current limits.
	-> Make an electron application.
	-> Gain familiarity with D3JS a popular visualisation library.
	
	Use cases
	-> Casual user wanting to see pretty grahps of their input
	-> Gamer wanting to see how they did better in one match vs another in terms of input
	-> Keyboard manufacturer wanting to see which keys are pressed the most and most likely needing replacements.

	This project has been put on the backburner for the time being. I got burnt out on it.
	I will come back eventually to it.
	
	Frameworks used
	-> D3JS = Make pretty graphs.
	-> Electron = Used to create native applications in Javascript (Skype, Slack, Discord use it for example).
	-> io-hook = gain key press information.
